# LU4P - Luma Updater 4 PC
                                            

## What is this?
This is a simple (kinda useless) script that uses the Github API to download the latest release of Luma3DS.
There's also an option for downloading the source code (a little useful for developers).

## Credits
- DefeatOf13 (Creator of the script)
